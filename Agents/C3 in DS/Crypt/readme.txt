C3 in DS: The Crypt (1.0)

After unzipping the agents into the "My Agents" folder and starting DS
you will have two more agents listed in your injector.

One is "The Crypt" and the other is "The Crypt (Remove)".  I hope
it's pretty obvious what these do :)

Injecting
---------
Before you inject anything just check the following list:
- Do not attempt to inject this into a standalone C3 world
- Do not attempt to inject this into a docked C3/DS world
- Do not attempt to inject this if C3 is not installed

Basically, this is for undocked DS worlds only, but you must have C3
installed.

Once the agent has injected you will be taken to the new meta-room.

There is no statue in the Norn Terrarium (if installed) but instead
a small headstone in the Norn Meso on the bottom level near the
Commedia pod.  A favourtite place icon is also created, but you may
have to use the headstone by clicking on it if you remove one of the
other C3-in-DS meta-rooms, as this will remove all the favourite place
icons.

Known problems
--------------
If the meta-room is injected into a new world or a world that has seen
no deaths, then you should open the tombstone viewer part of the crypt
(the right button) before the recent deaths part (the left button).

If you attempt to use the left button first then the crypt viewer will
be destroyed due to an error.

Don't worry if this happens - the meta-room will re-create it after a
few seconds.  Once you have clicked the right button you can use the
viewer as normal from then on.

If any creatures have already died in this world or if you click the
right button first then this should never happen.

If I can find a proper solution to this then I will release an update.

Also, some of the graphics when viewing the creature history in the
crypt are a mixture of C3 and DS graphics.

Removing
--------
To remove the meta-room you actually inject the (Remove) agent.  Using
the injector's remove button on the installer agent will have no
effect.

When you remove the meta-room any creatures and eggs in the meta-room
are teleported to the heat pan in the DS meso.  You will lose your
favourite place icons but can re-visit the rooms again to put them
back.  This is done simply because it's the tidiest way to remove the
new favourire place icon.

General notes
-------------
It's probably a good idea to save the world before injecting or
removing the meta-room by pressing CTRL+R.  Then if anything does go
wrong you can quit the game without saving by pressing CTRL-Break.

Disclaimer (stuff that has to be said)
--------------------------------------
Bear in mind that the C3 meta-rooms and agents were not really meant
to be used in this way, especially removing them, so there is always
a chance that this could break your world.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
