Bounty Bugs (1.1)

These little bugs are tasty and fun for creatures to eat, but if left
alone long enough they have a little surprise in store.

Thanks
------
Thanks must go to Uttar of Creature Creations (www.creations2000.net)
for testing, finding a bug (the non-crawly type) and giving me some
code to fix it. :)

Version history
---------------
1.1
- The nest no longer falls through elevator shafts and upper level
  floors.
- The agent can now be injected using the C3 creator machine without
  causing errors (or killing the machine if auto-kill is enabled).
