"Camera Fixer"
"Use this to keep your Docking Station cameras in place.\n\nClicking this camera will lock all your Docking Station cameras in their current positions so that they cannot be moved by creatures or the hand.  They will even be forced back to where you left them when the world loads and they move.\n\nWhen the Camera Fixer is red the cameras are locked.  When green the cameras behave as normal."
