C3 in DS: Norn Terrarium (1.0)

After unzipping the agents into the "My Agents" folder and starting DS
you will have two more agents listed in your injector.

One is "Norn Terrarium" and the other is "Norn Terrarium (Remove)".  I
hope it's pretty obvious what these do :)

Injecting
---------
Before you inject anything just check the following list:
- Do not attempt to inject this into a standalone C3 world
- Do not attempt to inject this into a docked C3/DS world
- Do not attempt to inject this if C3 is not installed

Basically, this is for undocked DS worlds only, but you must have C3
installed.

The room takes a couple of seconds to inject and once it has you will
be taken to the new meta-room.  You will also notice a pair of
teleporters that link between the terrarium and the Docking Station.
These can be moved to anywhere you want.  The existing doorways and
Ettin accessways are no longer operational.

Removing
--------
To remove the meta-room you actually inject the (Remove) agent.  Using
the injector's remove button on the installer agent will have no
effect.

When you remove the meta-room any creatures and eggs in the meta-room
are teleported to the heat pan in the DS meso.  You will lose your
favourite place icons but can re-visit the rooms again to put them
back.  This is done simply because it's the tidiest way to remove the
new favourire place icon.  Again, removal takes a couple of seconds.

General notes
-------------
It's probably a good idea to save the world before injecting or
removing the meta-room by pressing CTRL+R.  Then if anything does go
wrong you can quit the game without saving by pressing CTRL-Break.

If you hear a "buzz" noise when a creature tries to use a teleporter
or when the hand tries to use it then that means a valid location could
not be found at the other end - try moving the other teleporter away
from walls or low roofs.

The rocks from the volcano in C3 are all classed as toys but cannot be
used as such by creatures.  This means that bored creatures see toys
all about them but remain bored because nothing happens when they try
to push them.  Extra scripts have been added to make these rocks
behave like toys.

Disclaimer (stuff that has to be said)
--------------------------------------
Bear in mind that the C3 meta-rooms and agents were not really meant
to be used in this way, especially removing them, so there is always
a chance that this could break your world.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
