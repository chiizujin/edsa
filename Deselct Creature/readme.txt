Deselect Creature (1.0)

Adds a button that can be used to deselect the current creature and stop camera
tracking.

Alternatively, you can use CTRL+SHIFT+N to do the same thing.

Note
----
The button is only visible when a creature is selected, so if you inject the
agent and nothing appears to happen then you probably don't have a creature
selected.
