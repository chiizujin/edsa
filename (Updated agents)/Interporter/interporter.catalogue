"Interporter"
"Interporter allows the creation of portable portals that let creatures travel from any one place to another within the world.  If a creature activates a portal, it is sent from that portal to another portal of the same color.  The portals can be one of up to 8 colors, or rainbow which works for any color.  Plus Interporter has a special bonus to it, when it first comes out, it's in the form of a ball that creatures can play with.  This ball acts as both a stimulus for toy, and machine, so it's double the fun.\n\nUsage: When Interporter is first injected, it comes in the form of a ball that creatures can play with.  In the middle of this ball is a red button, push it to expand the Interporter into full mode.  To turn the Interporter back into a ball, just click the red button at the bottom left of the unit.  Before a portal will open, the Interporter unit needs to be turned on, and there needs to be another interporter with the same color, or rainbow, on as well.  Once there are two Interporters with the same color that are on, both will open a portal that your creatures can enter.  After a creature goes through a portal, the portal it comes out of will not be usable for a few seconds, so the creatures don't just stand there jumping in and out of a portal.  As another bonus, when a creature goes through a portal their crowdedness drops a little.\n\nButtons(From left to right, top to bottom):\n-(Top Row)-\n-Teleport(blue comet), this will immedietly send a norn that is touching the portal to another portal.\n-Activate(green on/red off, lightening bolt), This turns the Interporter on and off.\n-Portal/Door(blue spiral/circle with slash), This allows you to set whether the portal should be seen as a portal, or as a door to the creatures.\n-Color(colored bar), This lets you choose one of the eight colors, or rainbow.\n-(Bottom Row)-\n-Collapse(red button), This turns the Interporter back into the Interporter ball.\n-Male Permission(green on/red off, male symbol), This lets you set whether or not males are allowed to go through the portal.-Female Permission(green on/red off, female symbol), This lets you set whether or not females are allowed to go through the portal.-Norn Permission(green on/red off, Norn), This lets you set whether or not Norns are allowed to go through the portal.-\n-Ettin Permission(green on/red off, Ettin), This lets you set whether or not Ettins are allowed to go through the portal.-\n-Grendel Permission(green on/red off, Grendel), This lets you set whether or not Grendel are allowed to go through the portal.\n - Note, to enable Geats to use the portal, you must enable both Grendels and Ettins.\n-Age Permissions Sign(blue < > =), This lets you set younger than, older than, or equal to, for the creatures age, see Age Permissions button.  This button isn't visible if Age Permissions is set to All Ages.\n-Age Permissions(blue Baby, Child, etc...), This allows you to set an age a creature has to be to use the portal, either younger than, older than, or equal to this age.\n-Input Port(round black hole), This input port will cause Interporter to automatically send a creature through the portal as long as it doesn't get an input of 0.\n\n\nCredits:\nI, Mugendai, made this agent, I wrote all the code, and I even made many of the sprites from scratch, though parts of it do use the C3/DS sprites as source material.\n\nFor suggestions, or bug reports, email mugendai@anime.ods.org"
