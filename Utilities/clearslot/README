Clearslot (1.0)

This is a Python script that will delete all image and body data files for a
specified breed slot in order to:

- Ensure that an egg agent will extract all of the necessary files (it won't
  overwrite files that already exist.)
- Avoid potential weirdness if you are manually replacing a breed with one that
  uses fewer sprites or body data files.

Requirements
------------
Requires Python >= 3.11

Usage
-----
Copy the file into your Creatures 3 or Docking Station directory and run it with:

  clearslot <breed name> <slot>

or:

  python clearslot <breed name> <slot>
