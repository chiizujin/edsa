"Norn of Infertility" 
"This agent checks for possible immortal and fast-aging Norns and attenpts to keep them infertile.\n\nThe Norn of Infertility can be toggled on and off by clicking on it.  When it is enabled it checks all the Norns every 5 minutes.  Any immortal or fast-aging Norns are then forced to be infertile every 20 seconds.  The time remaining until the next check is displayed above its head.\n\n\n\nThe Norn of Infertility checks 3 possible indicators:\n\n1. Norns older than 9 hours may be immortal.\n\n2. Norns with 2 or more toxins in their body over 95 may be immortal.\n\n3. Norns that reached adult before they were 30 minutes old are probably fast-agers.\n\n\n\nIf any of these checks are matched then a ''boing'' sound will be heard and the Norn's name that is displayed above the agent will have 1 or more extra letters added in front of it followed by a ! as follows:\n\nO = Old\nT = Toxins\nA = Aging"
