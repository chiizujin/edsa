Bounty Bugs (1.2)

These little bugs are tasty and fun for creatures to eat, but if left alone long
enough they have a little surprise in store.

Thanks

Thanks must go to Uttar of Creature Creations (www.creations2000.net) for
testing, finding a bug (the non-crawly type) and giving me some code to fix it.

Version history
---------------
1.2
- Lowered boredom reduction as it was a little overpowered.
- Fixed an "activate 2" script that was not sending its "from" value to a called
  script.
- Slightly increased bug movement speed to give them a little more hill climbing
  power.
- Added a kill script to one of the bounties so that it no longer stays around
  forever if not interacted with.
1.1
- The nest no longer falls through elevator shafts and upper level floors.
- The agent can now be injected using the C3 creator machine without causing
  errors (or killing the machine if auto-kill is enabled).
