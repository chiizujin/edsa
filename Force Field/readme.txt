Selective Force Field (1.2)

This force field can be configured to prevent certain types of
creatures from passing, based on race and life stage.

For example, it could be set up to only allow Norns older than Youth
to pass or prevent Ettins older than Child from passing.

Any creatures that try to pass, but are not allowed to, are pushed
back away from the forcefield (non-harmfully).

To turn the force field on and off click it with the hand anywhere on
the base or the pole.  The ball will light up green when active.

To configure the force field click on the ball at the top.

Version history
---------------
1.2
- The ranges of detection have been increased again slightly as
  Grendel in particular could still occasionally get past the force
  field.
1.1
- The force field no longer falls through elevator shafts and upper
  level floors.
- The agent can now be injected using the C3 creator machine without
  causing errors (or killing the machine if auto-kill is enabled).
- The range has been increased when detecting Grendels (or all
  creatures) as they could occasionally get past the force field due
  to their size.
