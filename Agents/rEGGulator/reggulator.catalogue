"rEGGulator"
"The rEGGulator will attempt to maintain a desired number of Norn eggs. If there are too few then Norns will be encouraged to breed. Too many and Norns are discouraged from breeding.\n\nThe desired minimum and maximum numbers of eggs can be set by clicking the number, entering a new value and pressing enter.\n\nThe rEGGulator can be turned on and off with the green button. This button blinks every five seconds as the rEGGulator works.\nThe rEGGulator has an input port and an output port. A positive value sent to the input port turns it on, and a zero or negative value turns it off.\n\nEvery time the Norn eggs are counted, a value is sent to the output port. If the number is under the minimum limit then the deficit is output as a negative number. If the number is over the maximum limit then the surplus is output as a positive number. If the number of eggs is within the desired range then 0 is output."
