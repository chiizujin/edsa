Selective Force Field (1.3)

This force field can be configured to prevent certain types of creatures from
passing, based on race and life stage.

For example, it could be set up to only allow Norns older than Youth to pass or
prevent Ettins older than Child from passing.

Any creatures that try to pass, but are not allowed to, are pushed back away
from the forcefield (non-harmfully).

To turn the force field on and off click it with the hand anywhere on the base
or the pole.  The ball will light up green when active.

To configure the force field click on the ball at the top.

Version history
---------------
1.3
- Added a "disappointment" stimulus when a creature is knocked back to prevent
  too many repeated attempts at movement.
1.2
- The ranges of detection have been increased again slightly as Grendels in
  particular could still occasionally get past the force field.
1.1
- The force field no longer falls through elevator shafts and upper level
  floors.
- The agent can now be injected using the C3 creator machine without causing
  errors (or killing the machine if auto-kill is enabled).
- The range has been increased when detecting Grendels (or all creatures) as
  they could occasionally get past the force field due to their size.
