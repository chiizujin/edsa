# Emmental's Docking Station Agents

**As of August 2025 this is the official site for my agents.**

Most of my agents are also mirrored at [Eem Foo's Archive](https://eem.foo/). The archive is actively maintained and is a great source of Creatures content.

There is (and has been for some time) an *unofficial* [mirror](http://www.creaturesvillage.com/emmental/) of one of my previous sites. This is likely no longer maintained.

### Downloading

If you just want the agent to install into your game then all you need is the **.zip** file from the appropriate directory. This is linked beside the agent's name. The rest of the files in each directory are the sources used to build the agent.

These little bugs are tasty and fun for creatures to eat, but if left alone long enough they have a little surprise in store.

## ※ C3-in-DS

A series of agents that re-create areas of the Shee Starhip from Creatures 3 in undocked Docking Station worlds. You must have Creatures 3 installed to use these. They include:

## ※ Electronic Butler ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Electronic%20Butler/electronic%20butler.zip))

This electronic device monitors the speech of creatures anywhere in the world. Any complaining of hunger or boredom are served up with the appropriate food or a toy. Food is created anew and toys are selected from what's already in the world and moved near the creature.

## ※ Gadget Shelf ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Gadget%20Shelf/gadget%20shelf.zip))

Are you fed up of Ettins, and even Norns, messing with your connectable agents? If so then put them up on a shelf where they can't reach them.

## ※ Home Spray ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Home%20Spray/home%20spray.zip))

This spray releases clouds into the air that help homesick Norns feel better.

## ※ Medical Monitor ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Medical%20Monitor/medical%20monitor.zip))

## ※ Mystery Agent ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Mystery%20Agent/mystery%20agent.zip))

This agent... No, that would spoil the fun :)

## ※ Noisy Maracas ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Noisy%20Maracas/noisy%20maracas.zip))

These maracas are fun for creatures to play with, but we all know how irritating they can be, and other creatures feel the same way...

## ※ Norn of Infertility ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Norn%20of%20Infertility/norn%20of%20infertility.zip))

## ※ Roamer ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Roamer/roamer.zip))

This robotic spider-rock wanders around the world, occasionally releasing sprays as needed. If any bacteria are nearby then an anti-bacterial spray is released, and if any creatures are nearby then either a curing spray or a "feel-good" spray is released.

## ※ Selective Force Field ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Force%20Field/force%20field.zip))

This force field can be configured to prevent certain types of creatures from passing, based on race and life stage.

## ※ Towel ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Towel/towel.zip))

A tribute to Douglas Adams.

## ※ Trapper Planter ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/Trapper%20Planter/trapper%20planter.zip))

# Hosted agents

## ※ Remover Pack for Docking Station (by MNB) ([download](https://github.com/chiizujin/edsa/raw/refs/heads/main/(Hosted%20agents)/DSRemoverPack.zip))

This pack contains three agents that can help your game run a bit faster on older hardware.

The DS extras remover will remove some agents and most of the ecosystem -- but don't worry about food as the tubas will still grow from time to time. The other two agents are for DS docked or undocked worlds that use the C3-in-DS desert or aquarium. These agents will remove all of the ecosystem from both rooms.
