**As of August 2025 this is the official site for my agents.**

Most of my agents are also mirrored at [Eem Foo's Archive](https://eem.foo/). The archive is actively maintained and is a great source of Creatures content.

There is (and has been for some time) an *unofficial* [mirror](http://www.creaturesvillage.com/emmental/) of one of my previous sites. This is likely no longer maintained.

### Downloading

If you just want the agent to install into your game then all you need is the **.zip** file from the appropriate directory. You can download this directly by clicking the ðŸ Ÿ link beside the agent's name in the list below. The rest of the files in each directory are the sources used to build the agent.

This pack contains three agents that can help your game run a bit faster on older hardware.

The DS extras remover will remove some agents and most of the ecosystem -- but don't worry about food as the tubas will still grow from time to time. The other two agents are for DS docked or undocked worlds that use the C3-in-DS desert or aquarium. These agents will remove all of the ecosystem from both rooms.
