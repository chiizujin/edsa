Electronic Butler (1.1)

This electronic device monitors the speech of creatures anywhere in the world,
and any that complain of hunger or boredom are served up with the appropriate
food or a toy.

Food is created anew and toys are selected from those already in the world and
moved near the creature.

The butler can be turned on and off by clicking it.

General notes
-------------
- If more than one creature speaks simultaneously then the butler will probably
  not be able to service both of them at that time.
- When food is created and toys are moved, the creature will not necessarily use
  the one created/moved if there are others about.
- The butler only understands English.

Version history
---------------
1.1
- Removed URGEs.
- Slowed down the animation.
- The butler no longer listens for creatures complaining of illness.
- Changed the "can be picked up" check for toys to check creatures rather than
  the hand. You may not want toys being moved if creatures aren't allowed to
  move them.
- Toys are no longer moved if there is already one close to the creature.
- Removed the ability to inject the agent into standalone Creatures 3.

Credits
-------
The idea for this agent (or at least for something very similar) was given to me
a long time ago by someone I now can't remember. I'm crediting them as "unknown"
and just saying "you know who you are".
