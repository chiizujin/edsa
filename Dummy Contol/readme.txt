Dummy Control (1.2)

This control panel allows you to make the training dummy moveable by
the hand (you).

The top button (the grabbing hand) makes the dummy moveable and you
will see it jump as it is released.  The bottom button (the pointing
hand) teleports the dummy back to its original place in the Workshop
and fixes it down again.

The eyes of the dummy on the control panel will be green when the
dummy is moveable.

The control panel can be left in the world or injected as needed then
removed.  The dummy will remain moveable without the agent needing to be present.

  level floors.
